This repository contains a work-in-progress eventing system that is designed to
address a common need for cloud native development:

1. Services are loosely coupled during development and deployed independently
1. A producer can generate events before a consumer is listening, and a consumer
   can express an interest in an event or class of events that is not yet being
   produced.
1. Services can be connected to create new applications
   - without modifying producer or consumer, and
   - with the ability to select a specific subset of events from a particular
     producer.

The high level mission of Knative Eventing is: **Enable asynchronous application
development through event delivery from anywhere.**

For the full mission of Knative Eventing see
