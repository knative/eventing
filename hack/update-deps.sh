# HACK HACK HACK
# TODO(https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/1065): remove when we can update top 1.13.0 k8s clients.
# k8s.io/client-go/dynamic/fake/simple.go has a bug until > v1.13.0, they did not set the scheme in the fake dynamic client.
# Because this is only for testing code to work, adding patch to update deps.
# produced with git diff origin/master HEAD -- vendor/k8s.io/client-go/dynamic/fake/simple.go > ./hack/k8s-dynamic-fake-simple.patch
