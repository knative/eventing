## Access metrics

Accessing metrics requires Prometheus and Grafana installed. Follow the
[instructions to install Prometheus and Grafana](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/docs/serving/installing-logging-metrics-traces.md)
in namespace `knative-monitoring`.

### Prometheus

Follow the
[instructions to open Prometheus UI](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/docs/serving/accessing-metrics.md#prometheus),
then you will access the metrics at
[http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

### Grafana

You can add the eventing dashboard to Grafana by running below command line
under the root folder of `eventing` source code:

```
kubectl patch configmap grafana-dashboard-definition-knative --patch "$(cat config/monitoring/metrics/grafana/100-grafana-dash-eventing.yaml)" -n knative-monitoring
```

Follow the
[instructions to open Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/docs/serving/accessing-metrics.md#grafana),
then you will access the metrics at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
