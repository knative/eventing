# This file is a list of example Brokers. Each could be used independently.

---

# By not specifying a spec, the default Channel for the namespace will be used.
# This will change with the 0.8.0 version, since CCP is being removed than
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: default

# By specifying spec.channelTemplateSpec, we guarantee a Channel CRD implementation
# can be used, and thus guarantee the durability of the events that are sent to this
# Broker, like here with Kafka:

apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: kafka
spec:
  channelTemplateSpec:
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: KafkaChannel
    spec:
      numPartitions: 3
      replicationFactor: 1
