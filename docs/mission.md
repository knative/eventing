# Knative Eventing Mission Statements

## 10-word version

Enable asynchronous application development through event delivery from anywhere.

## 25-word version

Knative/Eventing offers a consistent, Kubernetes-based platform for reliable, secure and scalable asynchronous event delivery from packaged or app-created event sources to on-cluster and off-cluster consumers.

## Full Mission Statement

The Knative Eventing mission has three main focus areas: Developer Experience, Event Delivery, and Event Sourcing. Developer experience around event driven applications is our primary focus, with delivery and sourcing acting as enabling infrastructure.

We leverage open standards when possible: CloudEvents, Knative Serving, Kubernetes.

**Developer Experience:** Enable developers to write, maintain, and support event driven applications by sourcing events from other systems and events from their own systems with a uniform experience.

**Event Delivery:** Provide a core set of event delivery specifications and standards. Enable a pluggable architecture for the event delivery mechanism so that developers and operators can choose the correct event delivery substrate for their requirements.

**Event Sourcing:** Provide a specification for how to create event importers as well as guidelines and tools for event providers to cleanly integrate in a CloudEvents environment.
