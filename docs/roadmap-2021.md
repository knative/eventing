# Eventing

## Next 3 Months (Short-term)

### Event Discovery

Event discovery have been a needed feature with many attempts to implement it.
There's a need that users can discover various existing eventing components. One
attempt to solve it was via the event registry and EventType CRD #929. The new
Discovery API offers a more promising approach.

We need a more unified story for discovery in eventing that potentially
leverages the Discovery API and aligns the event registry and EventType features
accordingly.

### Spec Solidification

Review and update documented specification to reflect the existing
implementation (v1 API).

### Better Trigger Filtering

Trigger filtering today is limited. We need more expressive filtering.

### Tenant Targeted Logging

Hosting Knative as a multi-tenant cloud offering, there is currently no means to
distinguish logging events that are necessary for servicing the hosted Knative
service and those that may be meaningful to a tenant consuming the service. The
tenant of the hosted service would like to see besides their hosted application
logging, pertinent log messages from Knative service to help diagnose their
issues. However, providing all logging messages from the Knative service
internals would be counterproductive for a tenant not familiar with Knative
internals

### Autotrigger Sugar Controller

Simplify operations for developers using Knative by allowing addressable
resources to have autotrigger sugar labels. AutoTrigger creates triggers based
on annotations on a resource, and then assigns owner references between the
Trigger and Addressable, allowing cleanup and a lot less operational complexity
with the developer thinking about fewer resources

### Remove v1beta1 API [eventing, flows, messaging]

Removal of v1beta1 APIs as per
[our deprecation policy](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/mechanics/release-versioning-principles/).
We guarantee 9 months of support for v1beta1 APIs. This makes the release
18/05/2021 the earliest release where we can remove v1beta1 API, and we want to
target that release.

### Protocol negotiation contract

Defined a standard that senders and receivers could use to communicate or
negotiate protocol versions and features for a request, or a connection session
to advance our capabilities, without leaving existing containers behind.

**Theme:** Multiple protocol and protocol option support

### Preflight protocol negotiation

### Streaming Processing

The goal of this proposal is to build an efficient event mesh that allows
stateless and stateful even processing. We want to empower end users to describe
event flows, made by streams and processors.

# Eventing Sources

## Next 3 Months (Short-term)

### Multi-Tenant Kafka Source

Introduce a multi-tenant KafkaSource implementation capable of handling more
than one source instance at a time, typically all source instances in a
namespace or all source instances in a cluster.

The goal of multi-tenant receive adapters is to minimize the cost of running
sources that are barely (i.e. no or few processed events) used at a particular
point in time.

### GitHub Vanity domain support

The MT githubsource controller generates webhook of the form
`http://githubsource-adapter.knative-sources.<domain>/<ns>/<name>` where `ns`
and `name` corresponds the githubsource CR.

Instead it should generate webhook of the form `http://<name>.<ns>.<domain>.`

### Various QoS guarantees for Kakfa

Today only at-least-once and ordered is supported by the Kafka-backed channel
implementation. At-most-once and unordered should also be supported.

### HTTP/2

Support HTTP/2 in eventing components supports transparently with possibly
little/zero configuration in the full event flow
