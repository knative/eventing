# Object Model

Knative ships with several objects which implement useful sets of
[interfaces](interfaces.md). It is expected that additional objects which
implement these interfaces will be added over time. For context, see the
[overview](overview.md) and [motivations](motivation.md) sections.

These are Kubernetes resources that been introduced using Custom Resource
Definitions. They will have the expected _ObjectMeta_, _Spec_, _Status_ fields.
This document details our _Spec_ and _Status_ customizations.
