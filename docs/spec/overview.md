# Resource Types

The API defines and provides a complete implementation for
[Subscription](spec.md#kind-subscription) and abstract resource definitions for
[Channels](spec.md#kind-channel) and
[ClusterChannelProvisioners](spec.md#kind-clusterchannelprovisioner) which may
be fulfilled by multiple backing implementations (much like the Kubernetes
Ingress resource).

With extensibility and composability as a goal of Knative Eventing, the eventing
API defines several resources that can be reduced down to well understood
contracts. These eventing resource interfaces may be fulfilled by other
Kubernetes objects and then composed in the same way as the concrete objects.
The interfaces are ([Addressable](interfaces.md#addressable),
[Subscribable](interfaces.md#Subscribable), [Callable](interfaces.md#callable)).
For more details, see [Interface Contracts](interfaces.md).

- A **Subscription** describes the transformation of an event and optional
  forwarding of a returned event.

- A **Channel** provides event persistence and fanout of events from a
  well-known input address to multiple outputs described by _Subscriptions_.

- **ClusterChannelProvisioners** implement strategies for realizing backing
  resources for different implementations of _Channels_ currently active in the
  eventing system.

Sources are defined by independent CRDs that can be installed into a cluster.

[Knative Eventing Sources](https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources).

## Subscription

**Subscriptions** describe a flow of events from one _Channel_ to the next
Channel\* through transformations (such as a Knative Service which processes
CloudEvents over HTTP). A _Subscription_ controller resolves the addresses of
transformations (`subscriber`) and destination storage (`result`) through the
_Callable_ and _Addressable_ interface contracts, and writes the resolved
addresses to the _Channel_ in the `channel` reference. _Subscriptions_ do not
need to specify both a transformation and a storage destination, but at least
one must be provided.

All event delivery linkage from a **Subscription** is 1:1 – only a single
`channel`, `subscriber`, and `result` may be provided.

For more details, see [Kind: Subscription](spec.md#kind-subscription).

## Channel

**Channel** provides an event delivery mechanism which can fan out received
events to multiple destinations via _Subscriptions_. A _Channel_ has a single
inbound _Addressable_ interface which may accept events delivered directly or
forwarded from multiple _Subscriptions_. Different _Channels_ may implement
different degrees of persistence. Event delivery order is dependent on the
backing implementation of the _Channel_ provided by the
_ClusterChannelProvisioner_.

Event selection on a _Channel_ is 1:N – a single _Channel_ may fan out to
multiple _Subscriptions_.

See [Kind: Channel](spec.md#kind-channel).

## ClusterChannelProvisioner

**ClusterChannelProvisioner** catalogs available implementations of _Channels_.
_ClusterChannelProvisioners_ hold a JSON Schema that is used to validate the
_Channel_ input arguments. _ClusterChannelProvisioners_ make it possible to
provide cluster wide defaults for the _Channels_ they provision.

_ClusterChannelProvisioners_ do not directly handle events. They are 1:N with
_Channels_.

For more details, see
[Kind: ClusterChannelProvisioner](spec.md#kind-clusterchannelprovisioner).
