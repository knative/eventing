# Duty

Every week we dedicate one individual (the community contact) to watch for user
issues and either answer them or redirect the questions to other who can. The
community contact's duty (subject to change) is as followed:

## Daily check list

- Check the knative-users@ mailing list and #eventing-questions Slack channel for
  new unanswered questions.
- Check
  [unassigned issues / untriaged issues](https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+no%3Amilestone)
  for unanswered questions.
- You should already be added to @eventing-help usergroup by the previous contact
  person, and will be tagged into user questions in other channels.

## Weekly check list

### Monday

- Check 'Eventing Triage' Peribolos group
  https://github.com/knative/community/blob/509d00841920181611a8457da3f655ef014ff9bf/peribolos/knative.yaml#L669
  and send a PR to add yourself if you aren't already in there.
- Check the [Eventing test grid](https://testgrid.knative.dev/eventing) for
  flakiness to pick a test and focus on fixing it during your week. Once you
  pick the test flake, assign the corresponding bug filed by flakiness test
  reporter to yourself so that others won't pick the same test to fix.
- Join the @eventing-help user group if you haven't been invited by the previous
  contact person using this
  [link](https://app.slack.com/client/T93ELUK42/browse-user-groups/user_groups/S0191HUK2Q0)

### Tuesday - Thursday

Continue on fixing test flakes and answer

### Friday

- Remove yourself from @eventing-help usergroup and add the next contact using
  this
  [link](https://app.slack.com/client/T93ELUK42/browse-user-groups/user_groups/S0191HUK2Q0).
  If you don't have permission, ask in the Slack channel
  #steering-toc-questions.
- Email the next contacts, cc'ing knative-dev@ with a short summaries of the
  user questions encountered and links to them.
- File issue or document suggested improvements to this process.

## SLO

Participation is voluntary and based on good faith. The community contacts are
only expected to participate during their local office hour.

# Roster

We seed this rotation with all approvers from all the Eventing workgroups,
excluding productivity. If you are no longer active in Knative, or if you are
contributing on personal capacity and do not have time to contribute in the
rotation, feel free to send a PR to remove yourself. Similarly you can trade
your timeslot with others by sending PRs.
