# Knative Eventing Performance Tests

## Getting Started

1.  Create a namespace or use an existing namespace.

Create a ConfigMap called `config-mako` in your chosen namespace.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n <namespace> -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config-mako
data:
  environment: dev
EOF
```

[`NewConfigFromMap`](https://github.com/knative/pkg/blob/master/test/mako/config.go#L41)
determines the valid keys in this ConfigMap. Current keys are:

- `environment`: Selects a Mako config file in kodata. E.g. `environment: dev`
  corresponds to `kodata/dev.config`.
- `additionalTags`: Comma-separated list of tags to apply to the Mako run.

## Running a benchmark

1.  Use `ko` to apply yaml files in the benchmark directory.

```
ko apply -f test/performance/broker-imc
```

## Available benchmarks

- `direct`: Source -> Sink (baseline test)
- `broker-imc`: Source -> Broker IMC -> Sink
- `channel-imc`: Source -> Channel IMC -> Sink

## Plotting results from mako-stub

In order to plot results from the mako-stub, you need to have installed
`gnuplot`.

First you need to collect results from logs:

```
kubectl logs -n perf-eventing direct-perf-aggregator mako-stub -f > data.csv
```

Three plot scripts are available:

- Only send/receive latencies
- Only send/receive throughput
- Combined send/receive throughput

To use them, you need to pass as first parameter the csv. If you want to use the
combined plot script, you need to specify also latency upper bound, thpt lower
and upper bound to show. For example:

```
gnuplot -c test/performance/latency-and-thpt-plot.plg data.csv 0.005 480 520
```
