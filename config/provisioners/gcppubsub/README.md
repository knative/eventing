# GCP PubSub Channels

GCP PubSub channels are production-quality Channels that are backed by
[GCP PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/).

They offer:

- Persistence
  - If the Channel's Pod goes down, all events already ACKed by the Channel will
    persist and be retransmitted when the Pod restarts.
- Redelivery attempts
  - If downstream rejects an event, that request is attempted again.

They do not offer:

- Ordering guarantees
  - Events seen downstream may not occur in the same order they were inserted
    into the Channel.

### Deployment Steps

#### Prerequisites

1. Create a
   [Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
1. Enable the 'Cloud Pub/Sub API' on that project.

   ```shell
   gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
   ```

1. Create a GCP
   [Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/project).

   1. Determine the Service Account to use, or create a new one.
   1. Give that Service Account the 'Pub/Sub Editor' role on your GCP project.
   1. Download a new JSON private key for that Service Account.
   1. Create a secret for the downloaded key:

      ```shell
      kubectl -n knative-sources create secret generic gcppubsub-channel-key --from-file=key.json=PATH_TO_KEY_FILE.json
      ```

1. Setup [Knative Eventing](../../../DEVELOPMENT.md).

#### Deployment

1. Set the shell variable with the correct value:

   ```shell
   export GCP_PROJECT=REPLACE_ME
   ```

1. Apply `gcppubsub.yaml`.

   ```shell
   sed "s/REPLACE_WITH_GCP_PROJECT/$GCP_PROJECT/" config/provisioners/gcppubsub/gcppubsub.yaml | ko apply -f -
   ```

1. Create Channels that reference the `gcp-pubsub` Channel.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: Channel
   metadata:
     name: foo
   spec:
     provisioner:
       apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
       kind: ClusterChannelProvisioner
       name: gcp-pubsub
   ```

### Components

The major components are:

- [Channel Controller](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/controller)
  - [ClusterChannelProvisioner Controller](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/clusterchannelprovisioner)
  - [Channel Controller](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/channel)
- [Channel Dispatcher](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/dispatcher/cmd)
  - [Dispatcher](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/dispatcher/dispatcher)
  - [Receiver](../../../pkg/provisioners/gcppubsub/dispatcher/receiver)

The `Channel Controller` controls all the Kubernetes resources and creates
`Topic`s and `Subscription`s in GCP PubSub. It runs in the Deployment:

```shell
kubectl get deployment -n knative-eventing gcp-pubsub-channel-controller
```

The `Channel Dispatcher` handles all the data plane portions of the `Channel`.
It receives events from the cluster and writes them to GCP PubSub `Topic`s. It
also polls `Subscriptions`s and sends events back into the cluster. It runs in
the Deployment:

```shell
kubectl get deployment -n knative-eventing gcp-pubsub-channel-dispatcher
```
