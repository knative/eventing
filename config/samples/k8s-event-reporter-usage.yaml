# Example: How to configure a Broker with dead-letter sink pointing to k8s-event-reporter
# This configuration will route all failed event deliveries to the k8s-event-reporter,
# which will create Kubernetes Warning events for monitoring and alerting.

---
# Option 1: Configure dead-letter sink on individual Brokers
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: my-broker
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  delivery:
    deadLetterSink:
      ref:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        name: k8s-event-reporter
        namespace: knative-eventing
    # Optional: Configure retry before dead-lettering
    retry: 3
    backoffPolicy: exponential
    backoffDelay: PT1S

---
# Option 2: Configure dead-letter sink on a Trigger (overrides Broker setting)
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-trigger
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  broker: my-broker
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: my.event.type
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-subscriber
  delivery:
    deadLetterSink:
      ref:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        name: k8s-event-reporter
        namespace: knative-eventing
    retry: 5
    backoffPolicy: linear
    backoffDelay: PT2S
