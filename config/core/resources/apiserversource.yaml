                                            example, if the object reference is to a container
                                            within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to
                                            the name of the container that triggered the event)
                                            or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                                            (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax
                                            is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                            referencing a part of an object.'
