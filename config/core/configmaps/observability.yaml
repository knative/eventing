    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

     # metrics-protocol field specifies the protocol used when exporting metrics
    # It supports either 'none' (the default), 'prometheus', 'http/protobuf' (OTLP HTTP), 'grpc' (OTLP gRPC)

    #
    # The endpoint MUST be set when the protocol is http/protobuf or grpc.
